#---------------- Arithmetic Operators: -----------------------#

# Addition:			3 + 2	= 	5
# Substraction: 	3 - 2	=	1
# Multiplication:	3 * 2	=	6
# Division:			3 / 2	=	1.5 (float) in python3 whereas in python2 it gives 1 as output
# Floor Division:	3 // 2	=	1	Quotient 2 ) 3 ( 1 --- 1 is quotient
# Exponent			3 ** 2	=	9 	Squared
# Modulus			3 %	2 	=	1	Reminder ( Mostly used to verify number is even or odd)


#---------------- Comparison Operators: -----------------------#
# Equal:			3 == 2
# Not Equal:		3 != 2
# Greater Than:		3 > 2
# Less Than:		3 < 2
# Greater or equal:	3 >= 2
# Less or equal:	3 <= 2
